### Hi there 🖐🏼

I'm 24yo Senior Front-end Developer working with new awesome products at [Fitcard](https://www.fitcard.com.br/).

My current setup for Web Development consists of:

- 🖥 OS: Windows (with WSL) and Mac
- ✨ Frameworks: .NET Core, ReactJS & React Native
- 👨🏼‍💻 Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript (ES6+), Typescript & RESTful
- 😏 Testing: Jest

Also, I'm very enthusiastic about working as _"UI/UX problem solver"_, and sometimes I share my work made with Figma on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/jofelipe).
